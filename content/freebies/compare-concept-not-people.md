description: How to Improve others while improving yourself through Balanced Humility
date: 2023-12-26
---

In this blog post, I will write about the meaning of my **Chaotic** Life and what it means to be **Order** like my Brother, and also importance of **Neutral** (Balanced Humility - Talk like you're correct & Listen like you're wrong) and what I think about the future of our society. 

I also wanna compare multiple concepts such as [Tarot & Divination Cards](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#tarot-and-divination-cards) and [MBTI & Cognitive Functions](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#mbti-personalities-and-cognitive-functions). Also, the lesson learnt is that you never look accomplishment as just a end goal, and never stop trying and learning new things.

## Tarot & Divination Cards

[Divination Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot) is a way for Fortunetellers to tell how people to live in the present moment. Is it up to you whether if you want to believe me or not. These all could still be *fake*, and these are the **important terms** which I use in this post.

### The Fool

  I am the Fool, keep repeating the same mistake. In theory, we all are just **unique** people and like to have choices.

{% image src="/posts/compare-concept-not-people/fool-card.jpg" width="250" height="550" alt="The Fool" /%}

### The Tower

  The never-ending spire of chasing our dream(s). You might have heard about the fact that we are all **selfish** by nature. People's brain aren't actually wired for changes.

{% image src="/posts/compare-concept-not-people/tower-card.jpg" width="250" height="550" alt="The Tower" /%}

### The Justice

  Never pity yourself. Basically, people who writes with one's right hand, the ability to see **consquences**.

{% image src="/posts/compare-concept-not-people/karma-card.jpg" width="250" height="550" alt="The Justice" /%}

### The Greed

  Never sharing what you know, and stealing dreams, information, maybe even companions as well as also making **new** out of nothing.

{% image src="/posts/compare-concept-not-people/greed-card.jpg" width="250" height="550" alt="The Devil" /%}

## MBTI Personalities & Cognitive Functions

[MBTI 16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types) is also just a concept, but it is up to you if you believe or not. **Cognitive Functions** can be categorized to [Actions](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#actions) as well as [Perceptions](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#perceptions), then later on I will explain what is its importance. 

{% image src="/posts/compare-concept-not-people/mbti-cognitive-functions.jpeg" width="750" height="350" alt="MBTI Cognitive Functions Chart" /%}

### Actions

[MBTI Personalities](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#mbti-personalities-and-cognitive-functions)' `action` is influenced by **leadership**, either by **words/ action**. Each of us can only 2 `action` at once in each phase of our lifetime.

- **Introverted Feeling (Fi)**

- **Introverted Thinking (Ti)**

  What works for you, put your own life above others. _(Precision)_

### Perceptions

[MBTI Personalities](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#mbti-personalities-and-cognitive-functions)' `perception` is usually predetermined by childhood `abuse`/ `abondonment`/ `humiliation` or even `overprotection`. Us humans have the ability to *adapt to our situation* and depending on your open-mindedness, can have up to 4 perceptions which determine how we **process information**.

- **Introverted Intuition (Ni)**

  Ability to deepen intuition and get the overall gist/ bigger picture _(Vision)_

### Type Yourself

- **First Step**

  **Don't** even try to use a MBTI Personality Test to type yourself, instead learn how to type other people in your life starting with your family members using **all 16 Personalities** and check out [Frank James on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXSEPM58cSUy54rxsST4eVRDbK726MJCA).

  {% image src="/posts/new-year-new-me-2024/frank-james.png" width="750" height="200" alt="Frank James" /%}

- **Second Step**

  If you don't like your current life, never give up and always thrive for change and accept the true self. One might ask how to keep living your life without worrying how others think of you, I think the answer to that is [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).

### Childhood

I was always been addicted to computers and fascinated with how people made their own games. For example, `Dota 2`, `Starcraft` or even `League of Legends`. Daunted by the fact that game development is very much a superficial dream, so I have already given up my hope on acheiving my own dreams.

After getting my heart broken from my first school crush, I have always **resorted** to my addication of using `computer games` to distract myself from my problems. Then, comes with the thought that **trust** is what most important factor in all relationships.

> NO I'm not crying, YOU are

I understand **Family** is not going to be perfect at all times, and that every `father` wants to teach courage and protect, whereas the `mother` wants to teach compassion and intellect. My childhood was not perfect either, but I had a lot of fun in my own home with my neighbours and siblings too.

#### Dota 2

{% image src="https://esports.gg/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadmin.esports.gg%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2FPatch-7.33-Dota-2-All-map-changes-968x544.jpg&w=1080&q=75" width="750" height="600" alt="Dota 2 Map Layout" /%}

Above is the layout for the game of the genre `MOBA`, featuring `DIRE` (Chaos) and `RADIANT` (Order). There are also lanes so called `MID`, `TOP`, `BOT` in the layout where the **minions/army** from `DIRE`/`RADIANT` clash and fight.

Then, there will be 5 heroes from such side that fight till the enemy's `BASE` is destroyed (the `BASE` is at each corner). These heroes are controlled by people like my brother and me, would secretly strategize our plan to win the game.

To be honest, being alone and playing games by myself is not the **funnest** activity. So, anyone please, just hook up with me then I won't feel that existential dread ever again. Download [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home)

#### Shogi

During my Diploma years, I have joined the Japanese Culture Club before because I had prior knowledge to Japanese Language. That was when I created my own Chess board and learn the rules for playing [Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi).

{% image src="/posts/compare-concept-not-people/shogi-board-layout.jpg" width="750" height="600" alt="Japanese Chess Shogi Homemade"/%}

Please do come to my room if you want to learn and play Shogi. I promise you I won't go easy on beginners.

#### Cyberpunk 2077

{% image src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1091500/header_alt_assets_5.jpg?t=1702306332" width="750" height="350" alt="Cyberpunk 2077" /%}

[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/my/en/) is a thriller mystery adventure `game` developed by CD Projek Red that I enjoyed playing with my Diploma year friends. The reason why I love the game is because it immerse us in a [dystopian futuristic experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dystopian_films) and in a way it made me **very grateful** of the current state of our society. 

### Psychopathy

Psychopaths are people that just want to fit into the society, and gone through social isolation before. Probably, `greed` is what drives Psychopaths to keep doing their usual daily activities. During my social isolation, I have enlightened that [IxxJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxj) personalities are probably just people that lost their hope and dreams.

The role of a [IxxJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxj) is to help people no matter what. How cares if people wants the [IxxJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxj) unalive? What happens if people compare themselves with others? That, I can't very control what other people think to be honest, just cause I already swore by **the supreme philopsy** A.K.A [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).

> Philopsy breeds lives and culture

You might ask what does [IxxJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxj) in the [MBTI personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types) means? No matter what, we should to believe that we are all living in a simulation and you should treat people "right way". Please do check out [Egg Theory](https://www.hopelesslyellow.com/winter-2022/i-love-sushi-but-hate-to-eat-it-89d7b) as it have been the reason why I act the way to **others people's lives**.

#### Oyasumi Punpun

Oyasumi Punpun describes the **main character's growth** from Childhood to Adolescene and is an absolute masterpiece where I learnt how human personality grows. If you are interested or have the free time, I suggest reading [Oyasumi Punpun Manga Online](https://oyasumi-punpun-manga.com/) in your free time.

{% image src="https://oyasumi-punpun-manga.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cropped-wallpaper-1.jpg" width="750" height="200" alt="Oyasumi Pun Pun Poster" /%}

Asano Inio (浅野 いにお) is a **Manga Artist** I absolutely adore. His dedication to artistry and character development skills are to admire as you can feel the artist's passion expressing his **self-hatred** and hate towards Japanese's **toxic culture**.

#### Fears and Pyschosis

`psychosis` is about facing one own's `fear`. During the first time when I was undergoing `psychosis`, I have already have developed a deep `fear of love`. So after that, I have decided to became a shut-in **overthinking** what could I have done wrong so my sorrow and self-hatred kept growing.

> It's gonna be okay, I trust you to keep doing your best

So, what do I want to do with my life? Probably to help people find their **soulmates** and **their dream jobs**. Next, I will share what is , [Balanced Humility](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#humility) and [Social Media](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#socialmedia), [Male Loneliness / Social Isolation](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#maleloneliness)

### Burnouts

Adapting to their environment and needs, these are the people who are trying to fit in and often feel overwhelmed from Society or [Leadership Function (Te)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#actions) which can lead to Sociopathic Tendencies or [Violence Function (Ti)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#actions), thus can lead to Burnouts.

- **Productivity Burnout** / [Leadership Function (Te x Fi)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#actions)

  This will cause Sociopathic Tendencies and [Panic Attacks](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/anxiety-and-panic-attacks/panic-attacks/) manifested during [fear development](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#my-personal-cognitive-functions-of-my-lifetime) during our lifetime

- **Caregiver's Burnout** / [Caregiver Function (Fe x Ti)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#actions) 

  Existential crisis is how I describe my experience during my [INFJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#infj) / Adulthood Phase. This is a common problem with [Male Loneliness/ Social Isolation](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#maleloneliness).

#### Movitation & Feeling of Overwhelmed

Nowadays, people are always suffering from lack of motivation and attention span problems. But don't be afraid as I had have this feeling of overwhelmedness before.

### Social Media

Huh, I feel like the concept of `social media` have always been bewildering. I never touched `social media` before, because why should I? Because social media is just a tool to fuel people's **anxiety** and serve as people's outlet for their own **self-hatred**.

I understand that `social media` has its own good and bad, but I am just tired of people trying to use `social media` to act out their alter ego. Haizz... I sometimes wonder why all people can't just be kind to each other.

But nevertheless, `psychopathy` will always be required for society to function normally. Next, I will explain what are the requirements for acheiving `psychopathy`.

### Social Isolation

All People including me under effect of Social Isolation can lead to `psychosis`:

Effects of **Social Isolation** / `psychosis`:

- Nausea
- Hallucination
- Brain Damage
- Social Anxiety
- Panic Attacks

Next, I will describe how **Social Isolation / `psychosis`** felt like. First, I couldn't get my sleep schedule right, so during 3 sleepless nights, there were constant voices of [several difference identities](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#my-personal-cognitive-functions-of-my-lifetime) e.g. my childhood self, my school life, diploma self.

Then, I contacted my parents to take me home on the third morning. After sunset, I went to get dinner, then voices inside my head would keep telling me to **never give up**. Suddenly, the voices stopped, and that was how I acheived my [greed](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxj).

Nonetheless, it was a **terrifying** experience and I wish to never be socially isolated now. Ultimately, I am grateful that my parents came to help me get sleep and lesson learnt is to **never give up**. Now, To cure your fear of [Psychopaths](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#psychopathy), please also watch [Mob Psycho](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32182/Mob_Psycho_100). Don't forget that it is normal for all humans to have `sociopathic` tendencies.

> Man, being a Psychopath sucks

If you think you need help with **Social Isolation / `psychosis`**, please go find help with visiting [HealthyGamer](https://www.healthygamer.gg/). Never forget to take care of your own health, e.g. balanced diet, sleeping schedule, and **mental health**.

#### Ways to embracing your Fears

We mustn't be hasty when we are trying to face our fear. Therefore, here are the steps to embracing your fears:

- **Find Hobbies that act as Outlet of Sociopathic Tendencies induced by Panic Attacks**

  Some examples are `martial arts`, `sports`, `playing chess` or `practicing music`.

- **Never care about other people's judgement**

  It can be daunting to start a hobby and if there are fears of being `humiliated`, choose a hobby that doesn't involve more than 1 person.

### Balanced Humility

One might ask how to improve ourselves while improving others. We might have tendencies to compare ourselves with each others. Nevertheless, **violence** should never be the answer.

> World will remain a living Hell as long as violence exists

Humans can be good if they have the **courage to understand** and never resort to **violence**. I believe everyone can find their **soulmates** and satisfy their emotional needs through balanced humility.

- **Listen like you're wrong**

  Human are arrogant and selfish by nature, but we shouldn't resort to violence or compare ourselves with others.

- **How to influence others' reasoning**

  Practice Debating with your alter ego(s), please watch Vsauce's video on [social isolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqKdEhx-dD4). At first, it can be daunting to live in solitude and it can fuel to your self hatred.

- **Effects of social isolation**

  You can feel all the effects of social isolation while transitioning your personality into the [Greed](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people/#ixxj) personality

## Conclusion

I think I need to breath in more fresh air before heading back to UMPSA Pekan Campus, and damn does it feels good to be back at home. [Cognitive Functions](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#mbti-personalities-and-cognitive-functions) are the inner working of growth, pain, suffering, and also change.

I will continue doing my best at my role at being a [Advocate (INFJ)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#infj-(my-adulthood-advocate-neutral)). What are my beliefs? I literally *don't care*, as long as I do my part. I just wanna to be able to sleep again and yesterday's sleep was the best sleep ever. By the way, borrowing a quote from [Vinland Saga](https://myanimelist.net/anime/49387/Vinland_Saga_Season_2)

> I have no Enemies

Dear brother, I swear by god that I would never compare myself with others or seek revenge ever again. Please have a good night, forgive me for I have sinned for greed and will always pray for **World Peace**.
