Today, I can try to dissect why am I miserable and **overwhelmed** at this stage of my life. Also, I have been wondering what are my **real motives** lately during my visit to psychiatrist and what part of me must be fixed. Later on, I am going to talk about how emotion numbness can lead to **unwanted consequences** or how to leverage emotion to [finding our true self](/freebie/starting-off-from-a-new-leaf#finding-the-true-self). 

## Social Media and Mental Health

Currently, my mind is saying that I desire others' attention even though said about how social media is a `ticking time bomb` and oversells the idea of being a celebrity and a `legend`. I know that this statement brings up a lot of irony but I say **moderation is key**.

### Celebrities

I have always admired people that are living their dream life and have been wondering what are the **conditions** to being a charismatic influencer. Since there are so many influencers and dreams to chase, I also have started thinking about what are the **selling point** of being an famous influencer.

### Delusions and Obsessions

Is it OK to be not have dreams and obsessions? Is it abnormal to have **delusional** thoughts? I get that human that have no dreams and obsessions would eventually lead to *unfulfilling and miserable life*. But, what about the people that had nothing to begin with and didn't have the chance to truly shine.

> What is wrong with living a normal and boring life

It's **not** like I had nothing to begin with and I didn't ask to be **special** either. In another way, I have been asking what are the things which I cannot control A.K.A the past. Also, I did like to borrow a song from [Yorushika ヨルシカ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIgIJQWuBJ0Cv_VlU3USNA) called [Thought Crime 思想犯](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENcnYh79dUY) describing a `people pleaser` that couldn't change his ways of making fortune.

- **Wanting to be Heroic Protagonist**

  Starting with the most embarassing part of my past, I have been obsessed with **saving** others' life before prioritizing my own life.

- **Thinking that I am always right**

  Without considering what are the current life situation of others, I am guilty with **assuming** that people I met already have what I possessed in life.

- **Having no personality**

  I am currently feeling stuck with wondering what is the true self and why am I obsessed with wearing a mask / **facade** when interacting with others.

## Comfort Zone and Honor

We are all guilty of being in the **comfort zone** of relying on others to make process in our own goal. Even so, I still think that we all should have **honor** and keep standing on our own feet.

### Balance My Needs with Others' Needs

I think I need to start differentiating between my needs and what are others' need in life. Not only is it important to build a healthy ego, but start treating other people's life seriously.

- **Internal Expectation**

  Currently, I am just a student in the middle of studying Bachelor of Electronic Technology Engineering (Computer System), my internal needs are just to fulfill my tasks given by my lecturers or my friends.

- **External Expectation**

  Currently, I have several friend groups that different impressions on who I am. During my Diploma in Computer Science, I had always felt a constant peer pressure and that I needed to be **perfect** and show no flaws. Does it matter now? I am not 100% sure, but I think I should still shine and show what am I made of no matter what.

### Attention Seeker

**Attention-seeking** and **humility** are the two different terms but I feel like **humility** is just another way of seeking others' attention and validation. At this point, I think I just want to be confident and at the same time not go too overboard.

> [The boughs that bear most hang lowest](https://www.jas-hou.org/weekly-nihongo/2020/5/11/nihongo-words-of-the-week-week-8)

I have a feeling that I already messed up and made several friends and even my family members feeling worried. Sincerely, I felt like I already **emotionally manipulated** them quite enough. I swear to god that I will no longer pity myself and be the best version of myself from now on.

## Finding the True Self

As of right now, I have confused myself with emotions that I never thought I had before. One is self-pity, then two is the urge to blame others for my own problems. Based on our family and backgrounds, we might have certain biase and opinion on ourselves.

*Side note: I still highly visiting a psychiatrist before taking my advices or mostly* [Dr K's guide on Mental Health](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG).

### What is a Ego

Ego is something I have been wanted to research for a while. Through [Dr K's guide on Mental Health](https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyGamerGG), I have discovered that there will always be the **Emotional** self and the **Intelligence** self.

#### The Curse of Intelligence

Nowadays, society had always prioritized and demanded the **Intelligence** side rather than the **Emotional** side of our ego. This demand on **Intelligence** from people is going to cause a epidemic problem of [Emotional Numbness / Alexithymia](https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/anxiety-and-autism-hub/alexithymia). For example, when I receive a compliment from anyone, I would always think of it as *somebody's way of taking advantage of me*.


#### Emotional Wounds Needs Emotional Healing

One might think how one can emotionally heal and fix this emptiness. Here's a list of tips to be in touch with one's feeling:

- **Don't be Slave to being Invincible**
  
  At times, we might have to act confident, but we shall not be slave to being invincible or numb to emotions.

- **Always Value People's Identity First**
  
  People's identity or ego usually stems from fears developed during their past.

- **Avoid Logical-Trapping & Guilt-Tripping**
  
  We might have manipulative tendencies, but we should do our best to avoid people feel guilty.

- **Always Forgive People's Mistakes**

  Look at mistakes as a lesson learnt, never let mistakes be reason to not give second chances.

- **Let One be Blissful and Hurt**

  A lot of times, blissfulness and true authencity can hurt people, but that is how people connect in a deeper level.

## How to be Less Miserable

I am sincerely sorry for adverting the underlining issue of [Emotional Numbness / Alexithymia](https://www.autistica.org.uk/what-is-autism/anxiety-and-autism-hub/alexithymia). Lately, I probably need to find a way to fix my work-life balance and as of right now restlessness is how I describe my current life situation.

> This is Fine

I will probably also research how to emotionally heal those around me and learn how to avoid [toxic positivity](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/toxic-positivity-during-the-pandemic) and [gaslighting](https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/mental-health/what_is_gaslighting_abuse/) as it invalidates others' feeling / identity.
