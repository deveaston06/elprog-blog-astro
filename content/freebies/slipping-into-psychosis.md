[Schizophrenia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443) describe a mental disorder in which the patient interpret reality in an **abnormal** way. Symptoms that comes with the mental disorder is constant *delusional thoughts*, *hallucination* and *abnormal motor behavior*.

For my experience, it feels like everyone is constantly watching my every action. Often times, I even have this feeling that I don't exist in the planes of reality or **disconnection** from reality. In this post, I will explain my experience by starting with several **identities** living rent-free inside my head.

## The Judge in My Shadow

The youngest version of me, the [ISFP](https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality) Fool. Everytime I feel depressed or tired, I automatically revert my personality to this version of me. During my childhood, I always had a thought that people **don't like** to have me around. I recognize this as sign that I need to stop **projecting** what I experience onto random people I don't even know how they think of me.

### Self-Judgemental

This version of me is where all my values comes from. This **ego** is often looking for a clue to build up my **values** and my sense of self. Also, I'm always looking for clue that people **don't like** to have me around. The Music Video [Mirror](https://youtu.be/PkiIPzG37vQ?si=ZGY51zf5Rr5iwyuX) by *Porter Robinson* describe perfectly what it is like to be *The Judge in My Shadow*.

### Value & Ethics

To me, **Ethics** are the building block of a better society such as the justice system or one's self-restraint. Honestly, I just have feeling that my **values** aren't exactly the best which comes from my religion A.K.A *The Buddhist Teaching*, which I can give several examples:

- **No White Lies / Always be Honest**

  I believe that fake artifical flavoring is just a way to `emotionally manipulate` people around me. I used to love giving white lies and this belief stemmed from my fear developed in my past of being taken advantage of. Honesty is good in some situation but too much authencity will leave me looking like a creep.

- **No Escape from Reality / Self-Pity**

  It hurts just to think about my own problems, and it manifest as some sort of way to use substances to escape from them. Therefore, I think that this is the part where I heavily neglected.

- **Maybe Some People just Hate you Naturally**

  When I get angry, it is normal for people around me to start isolating me. I get that this is a oversight that **not** all people are `arrogant and selfish` by nature, but I can't get rid of this particular thought that by default people will not like me.

## The Mad Lawyer

The Late Adolescene version of me, the [INTP](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) Fool. Everytime I am interacting with my friends, I automatically convert my personlity to this *logical* version of me. During my adolescene, I always listen to music and play video games in order to distract myself from the true **problem** A.K.A my tasks and maintaining some relationship with my peers.

### Idealized Version of Me

It is the idea that people needs to the idealized version of oneself. Lately, I have been thinking **logically** instead of emotionally process the things that are happening to me. This version of me is not afraid of making up lies so that society can accept my *logical self*. I think that the Music Video [Hollowness](https://youtu.be/HIRiduzNLzQ?si=boDJozpK6eujbVnA) by *Minami* describe perfectly what it is like be have a *doppelganger*.

Note: _viewer discretion is advised for the music touches on the delicate matter of mental health problems._

### Eternal Solitude

**Logic** is the most powerful and deadly weapon for human to possess since beginning of time. The question is when logic becomes more of a **Poison** instead of a helpful tools for our daily tasks. [Red Pill](https://medium.com/heart-affairs/what-is-the-red-pill-and-why-are-so-many-young-men-falling-for-it-3045489a8eb7) is a manifestation of why so many young men are so lonely nowadays:

- **Logical Trapped**

  Like a lawyer, people like me nowadays are falling into the trap of `logical thinking` and use logic as a reason to not build healthy relationships with the people around them.

- **The Why Bother**
  
  Young adolescenes are always asking themselves why, and what are reasons to continue what they're doing. As you can see, this can quickily manifest in a viscous loop of `self-destruction`.

- **Toxic Boundaries**

  Using logic as an excuse, we are all guilty of setting up `toxic boundaries` with those around us. Instead of unconditional love, we tend to make transactional relationships to fill our void. Not only this is unhealthy, but it can cause a lot of problem in the future.

## The Restless Suspect

By social isolation, I am now the [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) turning into the role of **the Suspect** by adaptating into my environment. Combined with the previous 2 **egos**, the [ISFP the Judge](/freebie/slipping-into-psychosis#judge) and the [INTP the Lawyer](/freebie/slipping-into-psychosis#lawyer), I have turned into a `schizophrenic` person housing 3 **egos**.

### Delusions

I am constantly thinking about how to be `omnipotent` or planning ahead instead of dwelling in the past. Being an `omnipotent` means having **no fear** of getting hated by people you know. The music video [My Ordinary Life](https://youtu.be/9Zj0JOHJR-s?si=K1wSLE7ryPPtv5uy) by *The Living Tombstone* describe an `omnipotent` individual wondering which of 3 **egos** is the real self.

### Mind Playing Tricks

Being **schizophrenic** is not easy, you have constant delusional thoughts and how you handle the stress of it all is probably *meditation*. I can describe my experience as being **schizophrenic** like skating on top of a layer of thin ice. You can slip into `psychosis` at any point of your life if you're not careful enough.

- **It is all just a Game**

  Being schizophrenic means being slave to the thought that it is all just a `game`. You can do anything and get away with everything without suffering any consequences.

- **Intense Emotion of Guilt**
  
  Even though everyone tries to convince that you're not wrong, you can still feel guilty for something that you don't even have control of.

- **You are the Protagonist**  

  Inconsiderate of how other people think, you can appear as a loud and lousy narcissist. Sometimes, you can feel self-conscious and overwhelms you a lot of the time.

## All Inside my Head

Without eating my *medication*, I wouldn't be able to fall asleep without overthinking everything unless if I properly learn how to do *meditation*. I could try [Dialectical Behavior Therapy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt) but for the time being, I can try learning meditation to numb my emotions to being neutral for now.

### Anime Recommendation
