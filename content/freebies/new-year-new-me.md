First of all, I would like to express my *gratitude* for those who took care of me last year. In this blog, I did like to put all of my worries and `fears` developed during last year so I can face my fears carefully.

> Time to change myself for the better

During my visit to the physiatrist, I learnt that I need to stop becoming somebody else, and need to start accepting myself, the true self [`ISFP` (Childhood)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#isfp-(childhood-adventurer-fear-of-violence)). Therefore, the end of my `facade` and being friendy, fake [`INFJ` (Depressed Adolescene)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#infj-(my-adulthood-advocate-neutral)).

## List of Fears Developed

According to my previous blog post [Compare Concept NOT People](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people), I listed my fears developed during my childhood until my adolescene so **my first priority** in Year 2024 is probably to properly face my `fears` head on. Here is the *ordered list of fears* developed and *proabable solutions* to my fears:

- **Fear of Violence**

  `violence` is very connected to our ability to control our anger emotion, therefore I would like to practice my violin to serve as my outlet.

- **Fear of Love**

  `love` is a very subjective term, usually I can tell if somebody have a crush on me. But, `love` I feel like is very deeply root in our origins or childhood.

- **Fear of Psychopaths**

  `psychopathy` to me means wanting the best for society and the transitioning to fit into society, maybe am I just **overthinking**.

- **Fear of Imperfection**
  
  `imperfection` is a normal thing for human to have. There is a song by Cody Fry called [I hear a symphony](https://genius.com/Cody-fry-i-hear-a-symphony-lyrics) and you should check it out.

- **Fear of People I love Dying**

  `fear of people I love dying` is very normal for human to have also. I had several panic attacks thinking about people I love dying during my previous `psychosis`.

### Celebrities

There are several celebrities that I find to be very **Charismatic**. During my childhood, I have always wanted to become the best and strongest man alive. But for now, I will list a few **Celebrities** that I would like to learn more from.

## How will I live my Life

- **Sleep Schedule**

  Before I Sleep, I will take medication and play [Shogi](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#shogi) with my roommates/ friends.

- **Morning Routine**

  I would like to meet *my lecturers* and get to know them better in the morning after sending them an invite.

- **Free Time**

  If there is an invite, I would hang out with my friends from college. I would like to also *practice music* in my free time.

- **Destructive Thought**

  When I get angry, I would like to go to the **Gym** so I can burst out my anger issue quickily *before heading back to class*.

- **Weekly Scheduled**

  Write blogs on this website, jornal about what I was being to acheive in _Robotics Club_, and also if there is a chance, I would like to hang out with others. 

- **Holidays**

  When there is a **holiday**, I would like to hang out with my *loved ones/ family*, or even my *school friends*. Probably, write a post about what I find charming in their personality.

### How will I treat others in IRL

I would like to treat people with **utmost respect** and without submitting to *my selfish nature*, understanding them as a type of personality. If there is anyone who would like to have a free consultation with me, please feel free to come to my room after messaging my [Instagram (@easton_kok)](https://www.instagram.com/easton_kok/) account.

> Fake it till you make it

Also, I will gift my *loved ones/ family* with **anything** they wanted in real life. To address my loneliness, I will refer to this video [Loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3Xv_g3g-mA) from [kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell / Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) below and connect with other people using my true self [`ISFP` (Childhood)](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#isfp-(childhood-adventurer-fear-of-violence)):

#### Father (ESTJ)

**Sin of Gluttony** is how I describe my father, an [ESTJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#exxj), as he eats a lot. Currently, he is working as an **Excavator operator**, and had always worked in the construction fields for at least 20 years. Although we never talked too much, I am able to learn a few important lessons from him.

- **Help him with any Request**

  I will help him with any request he enquires. That is no matter *big or small*, I will never ever again reject his tasks as it is in his authority and I live his **shelter**.

- **Treat him with utter Respect**

  Although when he was never had any **tertiary education/ college** when he was a child, he taught the most important life lesson in life A.K.A. Never give up.

- **Never give the Cold Shoulder**

  From I was small, I always liked to have choices and also talking childhood my youtube addiction was inevitable. Thus, never again will I resort to my addiction. 

#### Brother (ISTJ)

**Sin of Sloth** is how I describe my brother, an [ISTJ](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxj), as he prefers the comfort zone. He is currently working as a **Management** in a Chinese Company. I can very much tell that he is getting used to the stressful life of being an adult.

- **Never blame Brother for anything**
  
  I am sorry brother, I will never ever again shame my brother for he is my **second father figure** during my childhood.

- **Not seeking Vengeance**

  During my first `psychosis`, I was finding a purpose in life and thinking I was unique, I blamed my brother for his protection.

- **Not taunting him**

  Althought *taunting and making fun* of my brother is fun, I will try to cut short in my taunting actions *(lol)*.

#### Others

- **Like How would I treat Myself**

  [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) theory suggests that human can only handle **150** friends in their **social circle**. Nevertheless, I will treat people like gold and *never ever give up on making connections* with people I adore.

## Conclusion

Like my father, I will **never ever give up on Living**, and accept my true self [IxxP](/freebie/compare-concept-not-people#ixxp) _A.K.A the Fool_, never give up on being greedy. *Like my brother*, I will always listen to **orders** from Higher Ups.

What are my Vision? None is the short answer. `long answer` is I will never submit to **authority** and keep taking my medications to make sure I stay alive. Probably, I will be a **Strategist** for others to *find their dream jobs*.

### Side Note: My Medication

My physiatrist said that my medication is to keep me from doing `wrong` things. He is proabably true, I can often feel the urge to be a **toxic** and truly grateful as there is a way for me to stay sane in the real world and stop the *viscous cycle of overthinking*.
